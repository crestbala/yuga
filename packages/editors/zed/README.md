# Yuga for Zed

Syntax highlighting (Tree-sitter) and error checking (`yuga-lsp`).

## Install

1. From the Yuga repo root: `make && make grammar`
2. One-time: `rustup target add wasm32-wasip2` (Zed compiles the extension to WebAssembly)
3. In Zed: command palette → **zed: install dev extension**
4. Choose `packages/editors/zed`

Zed clones the grammar from `packages/tree-sitter-yuga` via `file://`. That directory must be its own git repo (`make grammar` creates it). If install fails with **failed to compile grammar 'yuga'**:

```bash
rm -rf packages/editors/zed/grammars
make grammar
```

Then uninstall Yuga in Zed and install the dev extension again.

Open a `.yuga` file. You should see highlighting, and the status bar should show **Yuga** / **Yuga LSP**.

After `make` rebuilds `bin/yuga-lsp`, restart the language server (**editor: restart language server**) so Zed picks up the new binary. The extension walks up from the worktree to `<repo>/bin/yuga-lsp` first, then `PATH`.

For the `.yuga` file icon: command palette → **theme selector: toggle icon theme** → **Yuga**. Only `.yuga` files get the YG badge; `.expected` and other types keep the normal icons. The badge uses Zed’s `fill="black"` convention, so it follows the UI theme (grey on dark, dark on light), same as TypeScript.

## After changing the grammar

```bash
make grammar
```

That regenerates the parser, commits the nested grammar repo, writes the new SHA into `extension.toml`, and deletes Zed’s cached clone. Then reinstall the dev extension.
