/**
 * dce.h — reachability-based dead decl elimination for codegen.
 *
 * Only std-module declarations that the program can actually reach are
 * emitted as C: the entry module and everything it calls, everything the
 * C runtime/hosts call by name, and module-level initializers. Widgets,
 * codecs, and helpers a program never touches stop inflating generated C,
 * `cc` wall time, and wasm bundle size (per-widget opt-in, Phase 7).
 *
 * Runs after typecheck (bindings are resolved) and before codegen emission.
 * Typecheck, borrowck, boundscheck, IR lowering, and verification still see
 * every declaration, so errors in unused code keep failing loudly.
